**ons.dev** is a new Learning and Development (L&D) platform providing a better service than currently available resources within Government.

Initially piloting at the Office for National Statistics, **ons.dev** aims to build on baseline working knowledge of analytical tools, equipping developers with more advanced techniques to streamline and innovate data delivery and engineering.

**ons.dev** is an opensource, unlocked and free service providing industry-applicatable resources to extend developer toolkits, accelerate independent learning, and unlock potential to become senior developers, analysts, and scientists.

Content-wise, **ons.dev** provides materials to build on basic knowledge of tools/languages to design better, more resilient and maintainable software with hands-on practical exercises, including:

- Composition vs inheritance
- Cohesion and coupling
- Depending on abstraction
- Separating creation from use
- Building confidence on the command line
- Adopting effective branching models
